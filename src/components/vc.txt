It gives me immense pleasure to know that the students of the university along with their staff representatives have come forward for organizing the 9th edition of Annual Rohtak Medical Students Conference 2023 (ARMSCON 2023) from October 19Th to 21st, 2023. The students are very much enthusiastic for holding the ARMSCON as it holds great potential for networking, collaboration, and showcasing the latest advancements in the medical field.	 

This event is mixture of both academic and cultural activities where students of all affiliated medical colleges are invited. Various workshops and cultural events are organized during the event. Such types of activities are indeed the basic necessity for overall development of medical students where they can learn and enjoy.

I am very excited to attend this conference as it brings together experts from various specialties, creating a platform for knowledge, exchange of ideas and innovation. It is a great opportunity to stay updated on the latest research and technologies. I am quite confident that this event will provide an opportunity to learn through various workshops and also give them platform to show their talent.
 
I congratulate the Organizing Committee for their sincere efforts in organizing this event and wish the event a great success.
